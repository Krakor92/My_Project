# :notebook: My_C_Project
This repository is the base of all my **C** projects at ***Epitech***

## Content

### 4 folders
**include**: Contains all my header files.
**lib**: Contains all my library.
- basic_c :arrow_right: Basic C functions (string/int manipulation)

**source**: Contains some file code and a main.c
**tests**: Contains two folders and a Makefile that execute some coverage code with the lib *Criterion*

### 1 Makefile
It is composed of **6 rules**
- *all*: It calls $(NAME) rule
- *$(NAME)*: It compiles and links all my libraries and all my source code to create a binary
- *tests_run*: It calls the Makefile in tests which execute unit tests
- *clean*: It removes all object files
- *fclean*: It calls clean rule and execute the script mr_clean
- *re*: It calls fclean and all rules

### 1 script
**mr_clean**: It cleans every temporary files in the directory and in it sub-directories
